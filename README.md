# Employee-Tracker

## Description
For this challenge we had to make an application that allows a user to view an employee database using SQL. The application allows the user to view departments, roles, and individual employees. They can add new departments, roles, or employees or they may update existing records as they please.

## Installation and Usage
Clone the repo to you computer and open using VS code. Open the intergrated terminal and install the necessary packages using npm i. You will then need to edit line 12 by adding your personal password for your MySQL in the server.js file. You will then log into your MySQL and source both the schema and seeds file. Once this is done you will exit out of MySQL and type npm start to run the application. You will be presented with choices to view the database.

## Challenges
I ran into the issue of the database not showing when I run the application as seen in the tutorial video. I am able to access the database in MySQL but not outside of it. I am looking into the issue and hopefully it will be fixed in the future.
